<p>
  Cross country running is a sport in which teams and individuals run a race on
  open-air courses over natural terrain such as dirt or grass.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You will need your own running shoes and a running uniform which you can purchase at the uniform shop. The cost depends on which events you choose to enter in and the transport you take. You can attend running training during the year at school, or you may like to consider joining a club.
