<p>Gymnastics is a sport which includes balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, and endurance. Artistic gymnastics has 5 events, floor, vault, uneven bars and beam. For each event you perform a routine for the judges, who will then give you a score. </p>
<br>
<p>You will need your own leotard, and the cost completly varies based off what competions and transport you choose to enter. This is not a coaching program so you have to be doing club gymnastics outside of school. </p>
