<h1 class="title">Rangi Voices</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle" id="when">When: Friday mornings 8:00-9:00</h2>
<h2 class="subtitle" id="where">Where: Music Block</h2>
<p><b>Years 7-10</b> rehearse together once a week to learn about choir singing through a range of songs. Rangi Voices gives performances at school events (e.g. Clan and Carol services), sings in the community - e.g with choirs from other Independant Schools - and takes part in the annual national Big Sing competition.</p>
<br>
<p>They need to enjoy singing together and learn about what it means to be a positive and contributing member of a choir. It is not necessary to have singing lessons or necessary to be able to read music, it is an advantage though.</p>
