<p>We perform in a range of styles on percussion instruments and have fun.</p>
<br>
<p>All you need is to be enthusiastic, playing (or have played) an instrument, and the ability to read music is an advantage, but not required. You do not need to be learning drums or percussion, but individual lessons are available at school if you are keen.</p>
