  Cycling is split into 3 races for the school competition- individual time
  trials which is you racing as fast as you can against the clock. Team time
  trials is a group of 3 to 4 (5 for nationals) where you race other teams. There is a graded
  scratch where you race in a group of people about your level and it is the
  first person over the finish line who wins. For training you train as a team
  to learn how to do team time trials.

<p>
  You will need your own road bike and helmet, you will need a vest that you
  MUST wear to and from races. The cost is $35 per term, there are additional
  costs for attending events and purchasing gear. No experiance is needed, all
  levels will be catered for.
