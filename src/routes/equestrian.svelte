<p>Polo is a sport played on horse back with two teams, where you use mallets with long flexible handles which you use to drive a wooden ball down a grass field between two goal posts.</p>
<br>
<p>Learn to ride sessions is where you are taught how to ride a horse, and how to care for them.</p>
<br>
<p>If you are an experianced rider you are also able to compete in events through school.</p>
<br>
<p>You need your own mount for events, no equipment is needed for learn to ride sessions or Polo. The cost will depend on the level of involvment. No experiance is needed, newcomers are welcome. </p>
