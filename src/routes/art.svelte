Success in art comes from practice not talent! Come and have a go and make friends with fellow art enthusiasts in a warm and friendly environment! All welcome!</p>
<br>
<p>You do not have to have any particular skills to join. This club is free and open to all and you can join any time. Bring along some art to do and have fun!</p>
