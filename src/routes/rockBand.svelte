<p>In rock band we learn all the elements of how to play live music, prepare for Rock Quest and learn your favourite songs for a concert at the end of the year</p>
<br>
<p>There is no cost assoicated, however you will need your own instruments. You can join at any point in the year. Rock band is for years 9-11. It is run by Mr Kaa. It is a lot of work/effort as they meet everyday week day, however it is a lot of fun and something a bit different for musical students. </p>
