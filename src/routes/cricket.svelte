<p>Cricket is a sport which is played between two teams of eleven players each who score runs (points). This is done by hitting the ball across the boundary, or by running between two sets of three small, wooden posts called wickets. The wickets are at each end of a rectangle of short grass called 'the pitch'.</p>
<br>
<p>You will need white cricket pants which can be bought from the school uniform shop. Some cricket gear will be supplied. Twilight costs $15 plus transport, Regional Qualifer is $50 per term, additional costs if qualify for Nationals.</p>
